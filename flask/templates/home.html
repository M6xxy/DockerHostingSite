                        Our mission is to make Minecraft hosting simple, reliable, and accessible for everyone - from first-time players
                        to experienced server creators. We believe every community deserves a smooth, lag-free world powered by hardware built
                        specifically for Minecraft’s unique demands.
                        <br>
                        We aim to deliver an intuitive platform that gives you full control over your server without the complexity. With instant setup, powerful performance,
                        and smart automation, your focus stays on building great experiences - not managing the backend.
                        <br>
                        Whether you're hosting a private SMP for a few friends or designing a large modded world, we’re here to provide the speed, stability,
                        and flexibility your server needs to thrive.

                Yes. Once the File Manager feature is released, you'll be able to upload worlds, datapacks, schematics, and more directly through the panel.

                Player capacity depends on your package, but all plans allow unlimited player slots.
